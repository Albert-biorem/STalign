# Spatial Transcriptomics Registration
This repository contains software tools and examples for registering pairs of spatial transcriptomics datasets to each other, or single datasets to an atlas.

The package by converting datasets to cell density images, and using LDDMM based registration tools.  We include automatic and semiautomatic (with landmark placement) tools.

Two examples are included, illustrating registration of MERFISH to Visium data, and Allen Common Coordinate atlas to MERFISH data.


Here show example figure, same one Jean is workin on.
